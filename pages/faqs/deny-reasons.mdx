# Denial Reasons
Your bot most likely didn't follow our rules or requirements

Check our `bot-logs`  channel for the reason why it was denied as well as by what moderator.

Additionally you can also find the Denial Reason and Moderator in the DM from our Official Bot . 

> NOTE: It is also possible that your bot was tested using ``permissions=0`` to avoid this make sure your bot functions correctly with or without permissions (e.g: checking if user is admin instead of checking for bot permissions)
