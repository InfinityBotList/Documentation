# Webhooks

Infinity Bot List supports a webhooks system (that is still a constant work in progress however) for getting real-time updates and information about an [entity](./entity).

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Bot votes
- New bot reviews
- Updates on bot reviews
- Edits to a team (name and avatar only at this time)

More events will be added. Lots of our time was spent ensuring a sane webhooks experience for our users.

## Custom Webhooks

If you wish to use a custom webhook server you can start by setting up your webhook URL under Settings > Webhooks for the entity. Enter the URL you want the webhook to be sent to and provide a secret, you're all set! If you need help setting up custom webhooks inside of your bot or web server don't be afraid to ask in our [discord server](https://infinitybotlist.com/join) in the `ã€‹api-support` channel.

### Authenticating webhooks

So now that you have a webhook added to the site. You now need to authorize/authenticate the webhook and decrypt the data in order to handle it. **Note that Infinity Bot List WILL, from time to time, randomly send 'bad intent webhooks' to you to ensure that you are correctly handling security. Any webhooks that cannot be correctly parsed MUST be responded with a status code of 403 or the webhook WILL be automatically deleted during a 'bad intent' test run**

*Note that all examples are provided in JS as of right now*.

1a. Check the protocol version:
	- The current protocol version is `splashtail`
	- Check the `X-Webhook-Protocol` header and ensure that it is equal to the current protocol version

```js
  const supportedProtocol = 'splashtail'
  if (req.headers["x-webhook-protocol"] != supportedProtocol) {
    reply.status(403).send({
      message: "Invalid protocol version!",
      error: true,
    });
    return;
  }
```

1b. A nonce is used to randomize the signature for retries. Ensure a nonce exists by checking the header's existence:

```js
  if (!req.headers["x-webhook-nonce"]) {
    reply.status(403).send({
      message: "No nonce provided?",
      error: true,
    });
    return;
  }
```

2. Next calculate the expected signature
	- To do so, you must first get the body of the request
	- Then use HMAC-SHA512 with the webhook secret as key and the body as the request body to get the ``signedBody``. Note that the format/digest should be ``hex``
	- Then use HMAC-SHA512 with the nonce as the key and the signed body as the message to get the expected signature. Note that the format/digest should be ``hex``

```js
  let body: string = req.body;

  if (!body) {
    reply.status(400).send({
      message: "No request body provided?",
      error: true,
    });
    return;
  }

  // Create hmac 512 hash
  let signedBody = crypto
    .createHmac("sha512", webhookSecret)
    .update(body)
    .digest("hex");

  // Create the actual signature using x-webhook-nonce by performing a second hmac
  let nonce = req.headers["x-webhook-nonce"].toString();
  let expectedTok = crypto
    .createHmac("sha512", nonce)
    .update(signedBody)
    .digest("hex");
```

3. Compare this value with the ``X-Webhook-Signature`` header
	- If they are equal, the request is valid and you can continue processing it
	- If they are not equal, the request is invalid and you should return a 403 status code

```js
  if (req.headers["x-webhook-signature"] != expectedTok) {
    console.log(
      `Expected: ${expectedTok} Got: ${req.headers["x-webhook-signature"]}`
    );
    reply.status(403).send({
      message: "Invalid signature",
    });
    return;
  }
```

4. Next decrypt the request body. This is both an additional security to prevent sensitive information from being leaked and also ensures that the webhook has been implemented with a decent level of security on your server
	- First hash the concatenation of the webhook secret and the nonce using SHA256
	- Then read the body as a hex string and decrypt it using AES-256-GCM with the hashed secret as the key

```js
// sha256 on key
let hashedKey = crypto
  .createHash("sha256")
  .update(webhookSecret + nonce)
  .digest();

let enc = Buffer.from(body, "hex");
const tag = enc.subarray(enc.length - tagLength, enc.length);
const iv = enc.subarray(0, ivLength);
const toDecrypt = enc.subarray(ivLength, enc.length - tag.length);
const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv("aes-256-gcm", hashedKey, iv);
decipher.setAuthTag(tag);
const res = Buffer.concat([decipher.update(toDecrypt), decipher.final()]);

// Parse the decrypted body
let data = JSON.parse(res.toString("utf-8"));
```

### Acknowledgement

- Webhooks sent by Infinity Bot List **must** be acknowledged with a `2XX` status response (like 200 or 204) in order to be considered successful.
- Unsuccessful webhooks will trigger a [retry](#retrial).

### Timeouts

Responses to webhooks must be returned within 5 seconds, otherwise they are considered a timeout and will be queued for a retry (if available).

### Retrials and deletions

- Webhook requests that time out or return a `5XX` status response (like 500) will be retried up to 10 times.
- Errors resulting with status `4XX` (400, 422 etc.) will not be retried for obvious reasons.
- **Webhooks resulting in a status code of 404 or 410 will be automatically deleted, regardless of whether it is a 'bad intent' webhook or not**
- **Webhooks that respond with a `2XX` status code to a 'bad intent' webhook will automatically deleted for not properly handling authentication**
- *The above list is non-exhaustive*
