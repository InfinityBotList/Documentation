# Policies
We are, first and foremost, a community.
Infinity Bots has many features: partnership, certification, verification, and most importantly: chat and VC.
You should treat this server like you would you any other Bot List community.

 - The Server Admins have final authority on all server-related decisions, including, but not limited to, server content, membership, moderator actions, bans, mutes, etc. Their word is final, without further review. Admins have wide-sweeping authority and the responsibility that comes with it.
 - The Approvers have final authority on all bot-related decisions, including, but not limited to, approval, denial, mute, kick, ban, etc. Their word is final, without further review. 
 - Approvers have Infinity Bots related authority and the responsibility that comes with it.
 - The Moderators have delegated authority to mute, ban any Discord user. They exercise these permissions for the betterment of the server and to assist in keeping this place safe. 
 - Permanent bans are decided on a case-by-case basis and if a user is found to be particularly toxic or disruptive, may face immediate permanent ban.
 - Members who have specific complaints about another member should DM a member of our staff team or email us at `support@infinitybots.gg` Please do not publicly denounce someone.
 - The Admins and Moderators balance the needs of the community with the specific needs of an individual. When in doubt, safety and security will supersede the short-term harm that may come to the server. 
 - If you’re being harassed by a specific member, please let a staff member know. Even if they aren’t breaking a rule, if someone makes you uncomfortable, LET US KNOW!! We can’t help you if we don’t know. 
 - If a member of staff is making you uncomfortable, please let a Head Staff Member or Staff Manager know
