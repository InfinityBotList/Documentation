# Entity

An entity is an abstraction used by the API. It represents a set of objects (or entities) that uses shared code/endpoints to perform tasks. 

This makes the Infinity Bot List API more generic and allows for reviews, voting etc. to work out-of-the-box for new systems like packs and s
erver listing.

The list of entities in the API are non-exhaustive. Some entities do not support all actions, or may support certain actions etc.

- Users
- Bots
- Servers
- Teams
- Packs
