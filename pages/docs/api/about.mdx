## API Intro

Infinity uses a REST API for general operations such as sending and receiving `POST` and `GET` requests.

**For more up-to-date api reference, see [spider.infinitybots.gg/docs](https://spider.infinitybotlist.com). Please check this as well when developing against the API. Many endpoints on v4 especially are quite complex and nested and can't be documented easily here.**

#### Base Url

[spider.infinitybots.gg](https://spider.infinitybots.gg) (v4 API)

The older `api.infinitybotlist.com` base URL will continue to work but it is recommended for newer bots to use `spider.infinitybots.gg`

## Authorization

To access our API you need to authorize yourself or in this case your bot, this can be done by using your Infinity API Token which can be found in the `Owner Section` of your bots page.

Authentication is performed with the `authorization` HTTP header:

```
  Authorization: "your-secret-token"
```
