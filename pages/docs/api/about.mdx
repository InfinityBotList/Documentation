## API Intro

Infinity uses a REST API for general operations such as sending and receiving `POST` and `GET` requests.

#### Base Url

[api.infinitybotlist.com](https://api.infinitybotlist.com) (latest stable API)

[spider.infinitybotlist.com](https://spider.infinitybotlist.com) (beta API)

#### Beta API Note

[spider.infinitybotlist.com](https://spider.infinitybotlist.com) is the beta API and will always point to the current latest API version.

The current latest beta API version is `v5`. The current stable API version is `v5` (which is what currently runs on https://api.infinitybotlist.com)

**Note that in most cases, `spider.infinitybotlist.com` and `api.infinitybotlist.com` will be in sync and will point to the same server**

\*\*There are several breaking changes in `v5`. Your library should be taking care of these differences (such as 'flatter'/simpler to use API responses)

## Authorization

To access our API you need to authorize yourself or in this case your bot, this can be done by using your Infinity API Token which can be found in the `Owner Section` of your bots page.

Authentication is performed with the `authorization` HTTP header:

```json
{
  "authorization": "your-secret-token"
}
```
