# Votes

We offer a custom Voting System as a way for users to support their favorite bots.

Users can currently vote for a bot every 12 hours, with the exception of double vote time periods and premium bots (4 hours cooldown at this time)

_Not all endpoints are documented here. See [here](https://spider.infinitybots.gg/docs#tag--Votes) for more accurate documentation regarding our voting system
