# Votes

We offer a custom Voting System as a way for users to support their favorite [entities](./entity).

Users can currently vote for a entity every 12 hours, with the exception of double vote time periods, with 6 hour cooldown periods, and premium entities, if the entity supports premium, with a 4 hours cooldown for these cases.

See [our docs](https://spider.infinitybots.gg/docs#tag--Votes) for more accurate documentation regarding the endpoints provided by the voting API
