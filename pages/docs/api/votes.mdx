# Votes

We offer a custom Voting System as a way for users to support their favorite bots.
Users can currently vote for a bot every 12 hours, but this restriction may change in the future.

## Voting Endpoints

## Compat: Has User Voted

Check if a user has Voted for your Bot in the last 6 Hours!

**This endpoint is deprecated and as such is not documented at our autogenerated docs [here](https://spider.infinitybotlist.com/docs). Older libraries may however use it but this is _not_ recommended for use anymore**
