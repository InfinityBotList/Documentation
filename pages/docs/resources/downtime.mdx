# Downtime Handler

Our API implements a process for checking the presence of a bot and saving its current state.
Each time a bot goes offline and comes back online it is saved/edited in our Database as the Uptime!
Any approved bots who are offline for more then `60%` of their time listed on our website will be automatically removed.

This helps keep our website free of clutter and ensure our users can find a bot that is online and responsive when they need it!

## Percentage Schema

```jsx
let percent = (bot.uptime / bot.total_uptime) * 100;
```

---

## Exceeding the Downtime Percentage

The following actions will be executed if your bot meets the `60%` minimum

| Action      | Type    | Description                                                  |
