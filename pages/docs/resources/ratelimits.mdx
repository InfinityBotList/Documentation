# Ratelimits

Our API implements a process for limiting and preventing spam requests.
API users that regularly hit and ignore the limit will be blocked from our platform.
These rate limits are in place to help prevent the abuse and overload of our services.

---

**As of v4, all ratelimits including global ratelimits are dynamic and can be added/removed at _any_ time as we require**

- Not all endpoints may return these headers however these may still have ratelimits.
- A number for the purpose of the below table is defined as a number stringified

## Rate Limit Header Structure

| Field   | Type     | Description                                                                              |

| message | `String` | Error Message for the Rate Limit Response. This is a constant as per below and is static |
| error   | `Bool`   | Whether or not this is an error response. This is a constant as per below and is static   |

## Example Rate Limit Response

```json
{
  "message": "....!",
  "error": true
}
```

Clients are expected to use the `Retry-After` header. Ratelimit responses are now static to improve performance
