# Downtime Handler

Our API implements a process of checking a bots uptime in a periodic basis, however this is not finalized yet and so is not yet documented here.

The percentage system however is finalized as the below formula (in JavaScript)

```jsx
let percent = (bot.uptime / bot.total_uptime) * 100;
```
